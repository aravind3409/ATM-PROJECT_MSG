✅ 1. Code Explanation: ATM with Twilio SMS
You're simulating an ATM system with:

PIN verification

Options: check balance, withdraw, deposit

Sending SMS alerts using Twilio after each operation

Here’s what each part does:

🔐 Authentication
python
Copy
Edit
pin = int(input("enter your pin"))
if pin == 1234:
Checks if the entered PIN is correct (1234).

💰 Account Options
python
Copy
Edit
print("1. check balance")
print("2. withdraw")
print("3. deposit")
User can select what they want to do.

📨 Twilio SMS Setup
python
Copy
Edit
from twilio.rest import Client
ab = Client(sid, token)
Connects to Twilio using your sid and auth_token.

ab.messages.create(...) sends SMS alerts to your mobile after any operation.

Replace:

'twillionum' with your Twilio phone number

'yournum' with your verified phone number

🪙 Balance Checking
python
Copy
Edit
if choice == 1:
    print("your balance is ", balance)
    ab.messages.create(body=f"your current balance is{balance}", ...)
💸 Withdrawal
python
Copy
Edit
elif choice == 2:
    if balance <= credit:
        print("low balance")
    else:
        print("balance after withdrawal:", balance - credit)
💳 Deposit
python
Copy
Edit
elif choice == 3:
    if debit <= 499:
        print("minimum deposit is 500")
    else:
        print("balance after deposit:", balance + debit)
🔒 Invalid PIN
